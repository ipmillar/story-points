Story Points – Foundry VTT Module

Story Points is a lightweight Foundry VTT module that adds a draggable window with interactive coins. These coins represent a shared narrative resource between the GM and players—perfect for tracking narrative control, advantage, or momentum, inspired by systems like Genesys or Star Wars FFG.
Features

     Add multiple interactive coins to the screen.

     Click to flip each coin between the GM and Player side.

     Chat messages announce who flipped which coin and to what.

     Visual updates in real time for all users (no refresh needed).

     Only the GM can flip coins to the Player side (optional rule).

     Flip sound effect for satisfying feedback.

     Draggable floating window to place the tracker wherever you want.

 Installation

    Download or clone this repository.

    Copy the contents to your Foundry VTT Data/modules/story-points folder.

    Enable the module from Settings > Manage Modules.

 Usage

Once enabled:

    A floating window with 3 coins will appear on screen.

    Click a coin to flip it between GM and Player sides.

    All users see the same state, updated in real time.

    A chat message logs each flip and who flipped it.

 Customization

Want to use your own coin graphics?

Replace these files:

     modules/story-points/icons/player.png

     modules/story-points/icons/gm.png

 Recommended: Transparent PNGs at least 64x64 pixels.
 Sound Effect

To customize the flip sound, replace:

     modules/story-points/sounds/flip.ogg

 Adding More Coins

Want more than 3 coins? It’s easy!

Open the module’s story-points.js file.

Locate the coinStates object near the top:

     let coinStates = {
       coin1: "gm",
       coin2: "gm",
       coin3: "gm"
     };

Add more coins by following the same format:

    let coinStates = {
      coin1: "gm",
      coin2: "gm",
      coin3: "gm",
      coin4: "gm",  // Add as many as you want
      coin5: "gm"
    };

Each coin will appear in the floating window automatically and behave the same way.

 You can rename the coin IDs (e.g., destiny1, threatToken, etc.)—they’ll still sync and work just fine.

 Compatibility

    Compatible with Foundry VTT v10–v13+.

    Does not require any dependencies.
